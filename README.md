# ft-discord-scripts

A mirror of the Ruby scripts available for the Ruby script launcher bot added to
the unofficial FamiTracker Discord server.

To run a script called `script.rb`, post one of the following:

- `ruby script.rb`
- `./script.rb`
<!-- - `:ruby: script.rb` -->

Extra command-line arguments can be passed in the usual manner. The entire
message can be enclosed in tildes to disable formatting. Newlines in the command
body are treated as spaces.
